## Current educational endeavors

### Java

At the beginning of this year, I enrolled in the [University of Helsinki's free massive open online course (MOOC) on programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/). Unfortunately, the course translation is on hiatus since the end of April, so I'm unable to get certification yet.

Nonetheless, I've completed all available exercises up to part 12.
