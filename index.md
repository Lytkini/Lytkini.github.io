The section will be updated soon.

## Courses

### Java

The section contains some projects that I've done in [the University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/).

The course is not fully translated, so I'm not able to get certification yet.

### JavaScript, HTML and CSS

The section shows some projects that I've done in [the Odin Project web development course](https://www.theodinproject.com).
